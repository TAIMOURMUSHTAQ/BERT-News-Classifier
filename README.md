# BERT-News-Classifier
This project implements a BERT-based news topic classification system that automatically categorizes news headlines into specific topics. Using the AG News dataset from Hugging Face, the model is fine-tuned to recognize patterns in news text and assign them to one of four categories: World News, Sports, Business, or Science &amp; Technology.
